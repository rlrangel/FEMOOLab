## Implementations

It includes implementing a new feature, change an existing one, or fix a bug.

To modify the source code or files, create a [new branch][new_branch_link] from the master branch, and work on that branch to make the modifications.

Please check that all [tests][tests_link] are passing after finishing the modifications to the source code.
In addition, it is recommended to create new models for testing the implemented features.

Always try to keep the code organized.
It includes choosing clear and representative names for functions and variables,
paying attention to alignments and spacing,
and avoiding leaving unused code blocks as comments.

After the implementations are complete, make a [merge request][merge_request_link].
You should clearly describe the modifications and their purposes in order to facilitate understanding by others.

The merge of new branches into the master branch is subjected to the authors' approval.
