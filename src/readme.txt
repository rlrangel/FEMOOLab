Converting old version to the new one.
Getting old code from the folder "old_verion", outside git.

Deciding whether or not to adopt hierarquichal components:
-Element has:
	-Nodes;
	-Edges  (objs with their own shape and gauss);
	-Faces  (objs with their own shape and gauss);
	-Solids (objs with their own shape and gauss);

All edges,faces, solids of the model has an obj.
Element just gather them.
